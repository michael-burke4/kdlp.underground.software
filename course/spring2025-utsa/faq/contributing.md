## Contributing

Are you interested in getting extra credit in the course? Then read on.

If you notice any of the following:

* The directions are incorrect or could be made clearer

* There is a bug in our course infrastructure

* You have an idea for a feature that could improve the course quality

Feel free to let us know by opening issues on our
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/underground-software)
We appreciate the feedback. In addition,
we invite any interested students to work with us and improve the course.
We can guide you through the process of making the appropriate changes
and successful upstream contributions will result in extra credit.

Keep in mind that this policy covers _anything_ in the course,
including code, scripts, process, curriculum, formatting, style,
security, design, testing, automation, devops, site reliability,
IT, assignments, policies, or any other aspect that you can imagine
and convince us is a part of the course.

Extra credit will be awarded in proportion to the weight of the contribution,
and some particular tasks carry a [cash bounty](https://github.com/underground-software/contracts).
