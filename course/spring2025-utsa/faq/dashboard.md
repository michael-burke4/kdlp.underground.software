The [Activity Log](/activity) records all email you send as a part of this course.

The [Course Dashboard](/dashboard) attempts to match the emails you send

initial submission, peer review, and final submission.

The Oopsie button on the dashboard is the mechanism by which you exercise your [Oopsie](oopsie.md)

The automated feedback and score section will provide feedback when it is ready.
