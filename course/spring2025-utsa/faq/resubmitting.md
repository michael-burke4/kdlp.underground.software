## Resubmission Guidelines

You can resubmit as many times as you please before a deadline.
If you resubmit, you must regenerate and resend all the patch files and cover letter
as a new version of the entire patch series,
[incrementing the version number in the subject line appropriately](patchsets.md).

You must also document what changed since the last submission in your write-up,
include a section with a title like "changes since vN" where N is the number of
your last submission and you explain what changed.

You can resubmit a peer review by making a new reply to the original cover letter
with a new version of your complete review.

For any
[patchset](patchsets.md)
or
[peer review](peerreview.md), we will only grade the 
[most recent submission](duedates.md).
