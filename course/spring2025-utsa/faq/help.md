## How to get help in this course

The `#questions` channel on Matrix is the best place to turn.
If you're having an issue with something, chances are that
you're not alone and sharing your question publicly helps
everyone. Feel free to answer questions posted by other students.

Before posting a question, we encourage you to:

* Carefully proofread your command or code for typos

* Thoroughly re-read the assignment instructions

* Read any relevant man pages or documentation

* Read and research any error message or output

If you were stuck but manage to figure out something yourself,
feel free to share on Matrix.

If you are not able to figure out the solution yourself,
we encourage you to include the following information in your post.
The more complete this information is when you ask for help,
the easier it will be to help you.

* What you were doing when the error occurred and what steps are needed for someone to reproduce it

* Any input or output remotely relevant to the error

* Include as applicable all of the following:

    * The command you ran and the output

    * Your complete source code and makefile

    * Any error messages

    * Any `dmesg` or system log messages that seem relevant to the error

* Any references or resources you consulted during your troubleshooting,
such as man pages, websites, repositories, or documentation

* What you have tried so far to fix your problem

* Your best educated guess(es) as to what is wrong
