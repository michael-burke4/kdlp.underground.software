## Course assignments

Students will complete a coding assignment about once a week.
Assignment
[submissions](submitting.md)
are git
[patches](patches.md)
formatted for
[email](mailinglist.md)
by creating a
[patchset](patchsets.md)
that includes a
[cover letter](coverletters.md).
As a part of every assignment students will perform
[peer review](peerreview.md) on two other students
unless otherwise noted.

One fifth (20%) of each coding assignment grade on will be determined by the quality and thoroughness of the review.

In addition to coding assignments, students will be required to complete two projects throughout the course.
Students must deliver any required presentations over a live video call (with a camera)
Presentations must include original visual content, such as slides.
Students are required to include live demonstrations of their code by sharing their screen during the presentation.
Projects may include written content to be submitted as a patchset like the other assignments.
