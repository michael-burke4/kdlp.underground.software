## The Oopsie

There is one exception to the automatic zero for late work.
We call it the "Oopsie"

Once per semester---and only once---a student may choose to opt out of the
[peer review process](submitting.md)
for a given coding assignment.

By skipping the process---both giving and receiving---students can use the two days that the process
would normally entail to take more time to work on their final (and only) submission.

Skipping peer review means forgoing the safety net of receiving early
[feedback from peers](peerreview.md),
so it is the sole responsibility of the student who chooses this path to ensure that their
work is correct lest any defects in the submission negatively impact their final grade.
