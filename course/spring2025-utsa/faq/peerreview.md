## Peer Review Guidelines

For each student to whom you are assigned, you will do the following:

* Make a new branch off of master/main and switch over to that branch to apply the patches.

* Apply the student's latest patchset submission to your local tree

* Make sure each patch applies cleanly IN ORDER (a.k.a no corrupt patches, whitespace errors, etc.)

* Make sure the code compiles without warnings or errors

* Sanity check that any programs run without immediately crashing

* Make sure that the output looks reasonable

* Scan through the rubric, as each assignment's peer review requirements will be different

* If there are any problems with the submission, report them in your review

* If you determine that there are no issues with the submission, inform the recipient.

* If it turns out that there were issues with the submission that you missed, points will be deducted from your overall assignment grade

After completing your review, reply to the reviewee's cover letter email for the reviewed patchset as described [here in step 2](submitting.md).
