## Course Credentials

Students will be provided a set of credentials at the start of the course.
To obtain yours, navigate to the [registration](/register) page
and submit your student ID (the abc123 string) to receive a newly generated password with your username.

**Be sure to save these since they will only be displayed once**

If you lose or forget your credentials, get in touch as soon as possible and we will reset your password as soon as we can.
