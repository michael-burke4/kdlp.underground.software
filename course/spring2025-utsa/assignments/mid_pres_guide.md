## Midpoint Presentation Guidelines ðŸ”¬

You will create a short presentation about research into a topic of your choice and present your findings live in class.

### Outcomes:

- Enjoy independent research

- Practice your soft skills

- Give an engaging technical presentation

- Be creative ðŸ™‚

### Presentation requirements:

- You will propose a topic and outline ahead of time

    - Select a topic and submit your proposal with a short outline as soon as possible in the new `#midpoint` channel on matrix.

    - The proposal must begin with a one sentence summary of the topic you wish to cover (e.g. "What does .config do?")

    - The proposal must contain a rough outline of what you plan to discuss in the form of approximately a half dozen bullet points

    - We will reply to your message with the proposal to let you know if it is approved or what our concerns are if we cannot approve it
    
- 6 Â± 1 minutes long

- You must include some sort of visual component, e.g. a slideshow or diagrams

- You must include some sort of live demo in the terminal

- You must include discussion of some snippet(s) kernel code that is relevant to your topic

- You must present live during class time in the class Jitsi

- The exact schedule for which student is presenting on what day will be posted on matrix in the general channel

- We will not wait for you, so make sure you are not late on the day that your presentation is scheduled

### What to present:

- Share your screen for terminal + visual elements

- Example midpoint presentation topics (pick one of these or propose your own):

    - What is the OOM killer?

    - Why are there multiple versions of some syscalls with numbers at the end (e.g. `accept`, `dup`, `pipe`, etc)? What do the numbers refer to? What issue were they added to address?

    - Why do some syscalls have a version ending in `at` (e.g. `open`, `fstat`, `rename`, `symlink`, etc)? What issue were they added to address?

    - What does `.config` do? How does it interact with the build process for the kernel?

    - What is physical and virtual memory? Why is there a distinction between the two?

    - What is the history of git? How does it fit into the bigger picture of version control software?

    - How do container technologies like Podman, Docker, or LXC "share" a kernel with the host machine? What do they not share? What mechanisms of the linux kernel underly this technology?

    - How does the linux BPF system let userspace run arbitrary code in kernel mode? What techniques does it use to ensure that this is safe?

    - What concept does the phrase "Don't break userspace" refer to in the linux kernel? What does it look like in practice?

    - What is the linux VDSO? What problem does it try to solve? How does it compare to other historical techniques like vsyscall?

    - Or suggest your own!
