KDLP proc module

This module will create an entry in /proc that holds a fixed message for all users to read.

The file will show up in /proc as a file named *fill in the blank*.

The file will be owned by user *fill in the blank* and group *fill in the blank*.

The permissions for the file will be *fill in the blank*.

Operations:
	- Read:
		***REPLACE ME***
		* Describe what happens when a user reads from the file in /proc
		* How does reading interact with the file position?
		* Be sure to consider edge cases like a buffer that is too small, or a pointer to invalid memory
		* Don't forget to describe what value will be returned
		***REPLACE ME***
	- Write:
		***REPLACE ME***
		* What happens if a user tries to write to the file?
		***REPLACE ME***
	- Seek:
