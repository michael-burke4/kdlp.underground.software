### Notes

Start from scratch

#### The Barebones Kernel

What is the smallest config possible?

[silent.config](/demo_materials/silent.config)

```
# Allow turning off even more stuff
CONFIG_EXPERT=y
CONFIG_NONPORTABLE=y

# Save time by skipping compressing the kernel, we only want an uncompressed image for qemu
CONFIG_KERNEL_UNCOMPRESSED=y

# Build a kernel to run in m-mode so we can avoid needing a bios
CONFIG_RISCV_M_MODE=y
```

Build the config

```
ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- make KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=no.config allnoconfig
```

Breakdown:

* `ARCH=riscv`: specify non-host architecture to kernel build system ([Kbuild](https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/kbuild.html))

* `CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu-`: specify prefix for `gcc` command in order to invoke cross-compiler

* `make`: invoke the make program (the real command)

* `KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=no.config`: generate a full config using this file as a starting point

* `allnoconfig`: the makefile target to generate a config with everything set to no unless specified in `no.config`

Cross compile the kernel

```
ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- make -j $(nproc)
```

Breakdown:

* `ARCH=riscv`: specify non-host architecture to kernel build system ([Kbuild](https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/kbuild.html))

* `CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu-`: specify prefix for `gcc` command in order to invoke cross-compiler

* `make`: invoke the make program (the real command)

* `-j $(nproc)`: perform a multi-threaded build, creating as many threads as there are visible CPU cores on the system

* No target is specified, therefore `make` falls back to the default target, i.e. build the kernel (and generate `arch/riscv/boot/Image`)

Launch the emulator

```
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -nographic -no-reboot -net none -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image
```

Breakdown:

* `qemu-system-riscv64`: invoke the RISC-V 64-bit emulator

* `-machine virt`: specify a hardware configuration suitable for general purpose virtualization

* `-bios none`: disable bios loading (and later directly specify a kernel binary image)

* `-nographic`: disable graphical output

* `-no-reboot`: don't automatically reboot the OS exits or errors

* `-net none`: disable networking

* `-kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image`: assuming we invoke this within the kernel repo post-build, pass the resulting binary to QEMU

#### GDB

How do we see what's going on?

```
$ cat linux/gdbinit
# disable confirmation prompts to save time (for kill/quit)
set confirm off
# automatically disassemble the next line when stepping through code
set disassemble-next-line auto
# set arch to RISC-V (64-bit variant)
set architecture riscv:rv64
# load the symbol table from the vmlinux file
symbol-file vmlinux
# load the vmlinux file for debugging
file vmlinux
# connect to the remote host at localhost on port 1234
target remote localhost:1234
```

Relaunch the emulator. Why does it hang?

```
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -nographic -no-reboot -net none -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image -S -s
```

Breakdown of new arguments:

* `-s`: enable debug socket on port 1234
* `-S`: freeze the CPU and wait for continue from debugger before running any instructions


In a separate shell session

```
gdb -x gdbinit
... c to continue
... Ctrl+C to send interrupt
... bt to backtrace
#0  0x000000008012559c in udelay ()
#1  0x000000008000133c in panic ()
#2  0x0000000080127184 in kernel_init ()
#3  0x000000008012b4d8 in ret_from_fork ()
... kill to stop the machine
(back in the other terminal)
qemu-system-riscv64: QEMU: Terminated via GDBstub
```

How do we make this more detailed? Where are the line numbers?

Enable debuginfo in config
```
# Include debug symbols
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF4=y
```

#### Printk

Why did the kernel panic? ðŸ¤”

Enable some more options in the config

[noise.config](/demo_materials/noise.config)

```
... (trimmed)
# enable kernel printing output
CONFIG_PRINTK=y

# enable serial subsystem
CONFIG_TTY=y

# Add driver for serial device for machine
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y

# Allow using that serial port for console
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y
```

Rebuild config & kernel, then relaunch the emulator
```
ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- make KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=noise.config allnoconfig
ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- make -j $(nproc)
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -nographic -no-reboot -net none -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image
```

Silence... Why?

How does the kernel know to use this device?

(question for audience)


Another QEMU argument: `-append`

What do you think this does?

Kernel command line arguments:

```
earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x10000000 console=uart8250,mmio,0x10000000
```

Breakdown:

* `{earlycon,console}=`: specify information needed to print to a console early in the boot process and then during normal execution

* `uart8250`: Use the 8250 UART driver that we enabled in the config

* `mmio`: The kernel should communicate with the driver using memory-mapped I/O rather than I/O ports

* `0x10000000`: Base address for the UART device in physical memory

[(console= vs earlycon= and friends)](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html)



Let's run it!

```
$ qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -nographic -no-reboot -net none -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image -append 'earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x10000000 console=uart8250,mmio,0x10000000'

```

What is the [admin guide](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/init.html)?

#### The Device Tree

Can we do detect the device automatically?

Introducing the `menuconfig` makefile target of Kbuild.

```
ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- make  menuconfig
  â”‚     -> Device Drivers                                                                                                                                           â”‚
  â”‚       -> Character devices                                                                                                                                      â”‚
  â”‚         -> Enable TTY (TTY [=y])                                                                                                                                â”‚
  â”‚           -> Serial drivers                                                                                                                                     â”‚
  â”‚ (1)         -> Devicetree based probing for 8250 ports (SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM [=n])
... press y to enable
```

Can we search menuconfig this faster?

'/' to search: CONFIG_SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM, press 1

Note that we see the above path, which is also manual navigation instructions


Config is already recompiled, so just build the kernel
```
ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- make -j $(nproc)
```

Now we can drop the `-append...` argument to QEMU

```
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -nographic -no-reboot -net none -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image
..... (panic)
```

Without menuconfig, you can use [this baseline config](/demo_materials/dt_noise.config) and pass it as above.

#### Debugging the Panic

Why are we panicing?

Let's figure it out

First: brain dead

Give up and change majors

Second: small brain

Grep for text "no working init found"

`grep -rnw -e <pattern>`

* `-r`: recursive search

* `-n`: display line number in file of results

* `-w`: only match full words

* `-i`: be case insensitive

* `-e`: specify pattern after this argument (optional if pattern is last argument)

Third: Small-medium brain

`git grep`

Optimized search using git's database

Fourth: medium brain

Look for the function in the [source](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13/source/init/main.c#L1528)

Fifth: big brain

Use `addr2line` on address found in GDB output

```
addr2line <address> -e vmlinux
```

Sixth: Galaxy brain

Get good at GDB

Run the kernel and interrupt it
```
c
...Ctrl+c
```

Do a backtrace and select a frame
```
bt
frame <n>
```

Disassemble the current function or list the source
```
disas
list
```

Switch between various Text-user-interface formats
```
layout asm
layout src
layout next
tui focus next
tui disable
```


#### Init

What is `try_to_run_init_process("/etc/init")`?

Why does this fail?

Note: kernel is optimized during build so some code is skipped or inlined

Interesting functions to explore

```
kernel_execve()

do_filep_open()
```

#### Summary

* The essential functionality of the Linux kernel is quite minimal

* Cross compiling the kernel can be relatively simple

* GDB is a powerful and versatile tool with advanced features

* The kernel is just another program that you can debug

* The kernel is highly configurable and customizable

* Because the kernel is open source, you can read the complete source and documentation

* There is no magic in the Linux kernel, just engineering
